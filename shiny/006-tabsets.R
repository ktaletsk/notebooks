# This example demonstrates the `tabsetPanel` and `tabPanel` widgets.

# Notice that outputs that are not visible are not re-evaluated until they become visible. Try this: 

# 1. Scroll to the bottom of the `server` function. You might need to use the *show with app* option so you can easily view the code and interact with the app at the same time.
# 2. Change the number of observations, and observe that only `output$plot` is evaluated.
# 3. Click the Summary tab, and observe that `output$summary` is evaluated.
# 4. Change the number of observations again, and observe that now only `output$summary` is evaluated.
